trapperkeeper
=============

Description
-----------

TrapperKeeper is a suite of tools for ingesting and displaying SNMP
traps. This is designed as a replacement for snmptrapd and to supplement
existing stateful monitoring solutions.

Installation
------------

New versions will be updated to PyPI pretty regularly so it should be as
easy as:

::

    $ pip install trapperkeeper

Once you've created a configuration file with your database information
you can run the following to create the database schema.

``bash $ python -m trapperkeeper.cmds.sync_db -c /path/to/trapperkeeper.yaml``
## Tools

trapperkeeper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The trapperkeeper command receives SNMP traps and handles e-mailing and
writing to the database. An example configuration file with
documentation is available `here. <conf/trapperkeeper.yaml>`_

trapdoor
~~~~~~~~

trapdoor is a webserver that provides a view into the existing traps as
well as an API for viewing the state of traps. An example configuration
file with documentation is available `here. <conf/trapdoor.yaml>`_
